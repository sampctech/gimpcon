In this tutorial, which is designed for Photoshop users switching to GIMP, I show you how to make your GIMP 2.10 workspace look like Photoshop CC 2020. GIMP's highly customizable user interface is what makes this possible, and it allows you to really customize the program to whatever you like. Rearranging the dockable dialogues in GIMP will help you speed up your workflow for photo editing, and also open your eyes to how many hidden features are available in GIMP! 

Switching from Adobe Photoshop to GIMP, a completely free photo editor, has never been easier!
